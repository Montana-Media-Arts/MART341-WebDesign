Before we get too far, did you know you can leave notes for yourself inside your code _as_ you work?

Comments in code provide information meant solely for other human developers. Computers and processors ignore them during execution.

Let's go over a few reasons why you may want to include comments in your code.

1. **_Messages_** - Primary comments convey code information. Typically, this means _why_ some code was written in a certain way, or may also point out information to those collaborating on code together.
2. **_Reminders_** - Comments remind you of what you are working on. You can write notes to yourself about your work's goal or how you think you may go about solving a problem.
3. **_TODO_** - Use comments to remind yourself of what tasks you still have left to complete. Widespread use of comments is to place a "`TODO: ` "within your code and simply state what you still need to _to do_. There are even packages from editors, such as Atom, that can [show you a list of your remaining TODO's](https://atom.io/packages/todo-show) in a project or [highlight your TODO's for you to see easily](https://github.com/atom/language-todo).
4. **_Notes_** - They serve as a way for you to communicate your intentions and critical thought processes to your homework graders and instructor this semester.
5. **_Testing_** - You can turn code snippets on or off by delineating them as comments. This type of debugging is useful when hunting for errors or trying different ways of styling content.
