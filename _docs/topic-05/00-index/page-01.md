  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Additional HTML Elements</h2>
</div>


This week, we'll spend our time almost exclusively learning about additional HTML elements.

After a quick review, we'll move into structural markup elements like ordered and unordered lists. Lists are used continuously to communicate information, and HTML has very logical ways of working with them.

We'll explore several semantic markup elements used to add or change the meaning of text and prose. We'll also examine how to use links for other websites and e-mail.

As we dive further into HTML, you are welcome to utilize the textbook, <a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/" target="_blank"><i>HTML & CSS</i></a>.

By the end of this topic, we hope you:
<ul class="pros-and-cons">
  <li class="icon-pro">Are comfortable with structuring HTML documents and many types of semantic markup.</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">Have a firm grasp of internal and external linking.</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">Understanding ordered and unordered lists.</li>
</ul>
