</div>


Now that you've practiced using CSS, let's apply it to building pages that look and function with a cohesive theme.

You'll use your knowledge of CSS to create a standard 4-page site for an imaginary client. You'll also be introduced to placeholder and filler content while prototyping, as well as standard navigation and placement. This site should showcase:
1. Your understanding of color.
2. Well-selected and well-paired fonts.
2. Creative use of typography principles.
4. Use of positioning text, media, and layout elements.
5. Clean, legible coding.


By the end of this topic, we hope you:
<ul class="pros-and-cons">
  <li class="icon-pro">Have a self-made 4+ page site.</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">Showcase an understanding of CSS as a styling language.</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">Explored building a site based on a theme reflected across all its content.</li>
</ul>
