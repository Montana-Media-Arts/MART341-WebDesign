## Contributing
As the semester progresses, you should open issues whenever you encounter problems.

Note: The "The Impressive Internet" issue referenced in the example below is not part of our class this semester. Instead, our issues are organized by week, and you can post your questions or replies directly under the corresponding week's issue. 

There's no need to comment on the example issue below. Instead, reply to the Week 1 - Welcome issue. Please post about any issues you encountered this week or simply how you're feeling about the class.
