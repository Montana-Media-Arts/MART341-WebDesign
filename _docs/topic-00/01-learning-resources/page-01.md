The learning management system for this course will be [Canvas](https://www.umt.edu/it/projects/canvas/canvas-login.php).

There, you will turn in and receive grades for all submitted work, including assignments, quizzes, projects, and discussions. Homework is a community affair, and you are encouraged to view each other's submissions.

<span class="label label-danger">Important:</span> This **_does not_** mean copy each other's work. You should explore others' processes but only use them for problem-solving or ideation.
