<div class="divider-heading"></div>

The 'clear' property (`clear:`) controls how an element interacts with floated elements around it. When applied, it prevents floated elements from appearing on the specified side(s) of the cleared element (either left, right, or both) within the same parent container. This is useful for keeping elements from wrapping around or overlapping floated content, ensuring a cleaner, more organized layout.

This can be used to create vertical menus or control the flow of content with a containing element.
