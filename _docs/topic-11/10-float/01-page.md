<div class="divider-heading"></div>

The `float` property, like the `position` property, can remove specific elements from the page's normal flow.

The `float` property specifies that elements should be placed on the far left or far right of a "parent" or "containing element". All other material will then "flow" around the "floated" element.

The float property takes the following self-explanatory keywords as input values;

- `left`
- `right`
- `none`
