<div class="divider-heading"></div>

HTML5 also introduced the “figure” (`<figure>`) and “figure caption” (`<figcaption>`) elements to further assist with images. These can be used together to group figures or images with associated captions easily.

The **figure element** is the container that groups together one or more images with a caption. Within the figure element, one places an image and/or related elements and your caption elements.
