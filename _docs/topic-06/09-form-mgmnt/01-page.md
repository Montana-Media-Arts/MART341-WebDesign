If you've ever filled out a form at the Department of Motor Vehicles, you know that even paper forms can be lengthy, complex, and maddening. This happens on the web, too, but fortunately, HTML gives us several ways to manage how form data is displayed and received.

The first concerns labeling and accessibility. `Labels` and `ids` expand the clickable area to include all elements of the selection (such as the text) rather than just the button or checkbox.

Next, we can visually collect related form elements into `fieldsets` with `legends`. These create bounding boxes that signify when a new type of input is asked or group similar question sets.
